# Maintenance Script: Keeping Your Linux Box in Check (Without Losing Your Sanity)

## Introduction

Welcome, esteemed engineer, noble sysadmin, or brave soul who just realized their server is on fire. 🎩🔥  

System maintenance is like brushing your teeth—you can skip it, but eventually, it’ll cost you. This script is your trusty sidekick, automating crucial tasks like monitoring CPU and disk usage, restarting critical services, and applying security updates. Think of it as a tiny, relentless janitor for your Linux system, sweeping up messes before they turn into disasters.  

This guide will walk you through the script’s functions, ensuring that you understand what each piece does instead of just running it blindly and praying to the Bash gods.  

And no, this knowledge is NOT a waste—whether you’re a rookie or a battle-hardened sysadmin, mastering these skills will make you the unsung hero of your team.

## Usage

### Monitoring System Resources

This script logs and alerts you when resource usage exceeds safe limits.

```bash
CPU_USAGE=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
MEM_USAGE=$(free | awk '/Mem/{printf("%.2f"), $3/$2 * 100}')
```

If usage goes beyond a set threshold, the script will log warnings and send alerts.

### Restarting Critical Services

The script ensures that key services remain operational.

```bash
for service in "${CRITICAL_SERVICES[@]}"; do
    if ! systemctl is-active --quiet "$service"; then
        systemctl restart "$service"
    fi
done
```

### System Cleanup

Old temporary files are removed automatically.

```bash
find /tmp -type f -atime +7 -delete
```

### Applying Updates

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Logs

All script activities are logged in:

```bash
/var/log/system_maintenance.log
```

This ensures that you can track and debug system issues efficiently.
